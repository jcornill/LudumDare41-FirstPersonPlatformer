## Game

 We chose to create a 2D platformer, but instead of what the first picture suggest, you play it from a first person perspective

 The game contain 10 levels, and take 10 to 40 min to complete, depending on if you are good or not.

## The Team

 Kirthos (jcornill): All Programming and some Levels Design.

 Lio: Most Game Design, “Graphics” and some Levels Design.
